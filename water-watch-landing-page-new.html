							<p>It’s not a good sign when even the dogs won’t drink your tap water. “They sniff it and then drink the bottled water we pour,” said Frank Michna of Caledonia, one of hundreds of southeastern Wisconsin residents whose wells are contaminated by pollutants that may be coming from buried coal ash.</p></div>

In next-door Minnesota, traces have been found in nearly all the surface waters tested. But Wisconsin is lagging behind Minnesota in testing.</p>

In a state with about 15,000 lakes and more than a quadrillion gallons of groundwater, it is hard to believe that water could ever be in short supply.
