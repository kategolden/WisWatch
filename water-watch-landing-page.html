							<p>Reporter Kate Golden and artist Carrie Roy collaborated on a project to transform data from Water Watch Wisconsin stories into sculptures that you can see and touch. Now the Center is taking a felt trout stream, a life-size half cow and 1,000 balls of wool on the road May 1 - 7 to meet Wisconsin residents and talk about water issues.</p>

In next-door Minnesota, traces have been found in nearly all the surface waters tested. But Wisconsin is lagging behind Minnesota in testing.</p>

In a state with about 15,000 lakes and more than a quadrillion gallons of groundwater, it is hard to believe that water could ever be in short supply.
